"Connecting AI agents to the world"


## So, what is this?
We are an API for LLM to access APIs. Make an API call with a natural language query of anything you want to do: i.e "make a picture of a cat", "what is my current credit card balance" or "book a flight to New York City". We will then find an API endpoint to call on your behalf and reutn the results to you.


## Technologies Used:
GPT-3, Langchain, Weaviate, Typescript, NodeJS, Expressl, and cockroachDB
